      Fortify is a platform where volunteers and organizations can find the best match for their needs. <br/><br/>
      We aim to help volunteers, such as students, graduates, and self-taught professionsals, and <br/> organizations with minimal resources to hire a cyber security team.<br/><br/>
      Our goal is to fill in the gapes in the market. We want to rise employability for volunteers who are <br/> new to the field and help them gain experinece in cyber security. We also want to raise awarness <br/> about security threats to small organizations to help them protect their assets.
