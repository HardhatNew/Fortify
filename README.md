# Project-Fortify

This is the Fortify Project made for Hardhat Enterprises in Deakin University's Capstone Program.

## About

The Hardhat Enterprises Fortify project is a website platform that connects security cohorts and organisations together to provide help and even information about security. The front-end runs on React for its technology stack due to the numerous benefits it can offer. A domain name has been registered and an SSL certificate has been procured to be prepared for when the project is decided to be rolled out into production or even developed into a proof-of-concept functional website.

## Using MERN 


MongoDB, Express, React, Node
MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack. MongoDB — document database. Express(.js) — Node.js web framework. React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework. Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server. 

This stack is very robust as all the technologies work very well with each other and have plenty of security features that can be added over the duration of the project. Another reason for choosing MERN was because of the ease of adapting to and learning JavaScript.
